# ICSwift

## Description

A quality-of-life package of Swift property extensions to make our lives a bit easier.

If you have any suggestions be comfortable in _forking_ this repository and
create a **Pull Request**. I would be happy to have you as a contributer.

Some extensions used within this package can be found in the etcetera repository, from Jared Sinclair.

## Requirements

iOS 11.0+ 
Xcode 12.0+
Swift 4.0+

## Notes to contributors

Please use the implicit `return` whenever possible.

If you want to contribute to any present extension, or add more extensions, please don't forget to write a **Unit Test** for it, whenever is possible. It is important to test each custom extension to assert they work as expected and increases its reliability. 
(still ongoing)
